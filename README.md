Additionally, they help establish a positive reputation for the development team and the organization, fostering trust among stakeholders. Ultimately, ensuring quality throughout the project contributes to the overall success and longevity of the software product.
## 6. How does defining the project scope contribute to successful project planning? What is a Work Breakdown Structure (WBS), and why is it useful?
Defining the project scope is crucial for successful project planning as it establishes clear boundaries and expectations for the project. A well-defined scope outlines the project's objectives, deliverables, and constraints, ensuring that all stakeholders have a shared understanding of what the project will achieve. This clarity helps prevent scope creep, which can lead to delays and budget overruns, by controlling changes and maintaining focus on the original goals. Additionally, a defined scope facilitates better resource allocation and prioritization, allowing teams to plan effectively and execute tasks efficiently.

Work Breakdown Structure (WBS)
A Work Breakdown Structure (WBS) is a hierarchical breakdown of a project into smaller, more manageable components or tasks. It organizes the project into detailed deliverables and activities, making it easier to plan, execute, and monitor progress. The WBS is useful because it provides a clear visual representation of the project structure, helping teams understand task relationships and dependencies.
